<h1 style="color:maroon;font-size:40px;"> HISTORY </h1>
	<h3> 1887 </h3>
		<p>The National Museum of the Philippines can trace its history to the establishment of <br>
		the Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinas, established by a royal order of the Spanish <br>
		government on August 12, 1887. </p>

	<h3> 1891-1901 </h3>
		<p>The Museo-Biblioteca opened on October 24, 1891 at the Casa de la Moneda on Calle <br>
		Cabildo in Intramuros, then home of the Philippine Mint, later moving to Calle Gunao <br>
		in Quiapo. It was abolished in 1900 at the onset of the American occupation of the <br>
		Philippines, and what is considered the direct precursor of the National Museum, the <br>
		Insular Museum of Ethnology, Natural History and Commerce, was soon afterwards <br>
		established under the Department of Public Instruction by the Philippine Commission <br>
		on October 29, 1901. One of the reasons for the creation of the Insular Museum was to <br>
		complement the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, and it was subsequently integrated <br>
		with the Bureau of Ethnological Survey under the Department of the Interior.</p>

	<h3> 1904-1916 </h3>
		<p> In 1904, after the Louisiana Purchase Centennial Exposition at St. Louis, Missouri, the <br>
		name of the Museum was changed to Philippine Museum. At the same time, the <br>
		Bureau of Ethnological Survey became the Division of Ethnology under the <br>
		Department of Public Instruction in 1905 and then under the Bureau of Science, which <br>
		housed considerable natural history collections, in 1906. A decade later, in 1916, the <br>
		Fine Arts Division of the Philippine Museum was merged with the Philippine Library <br>
		(precursor of the National Library and National Archives) to create the Philippine <br>
		Library and Museum under the Department of Justice. The Natural History Division <br>
		and Division of Ethnology were maintained in the Bureau of Science.</p>

	<h3> 1928-1939 </h3>
		<p> In 1928, the National Museum of the Philippine Islands was created and placed under <br>
		the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and housed in a building in the <br>
		Port Area adjacent to the Manila Hotel. The National Library was also established as a <br>
		separate institution. The Museum consisted of the Ethnology Division and the <br>
		Division of History and Fine Arts (the Division of Natural Science was not included in <br>
		the organization). However, this was reversed in 1933, when the Division of Fine Arts <br>
		was transferred to the National Library, and the Division of Ethnology and the Division <br>
		of Anthropology, which included archaeology, ethnography and physical anthropology, <br>
		were combined with the sections of natural history of the Bureau of Science <br>
		and organized into the National Museum Division of the Bureau of Science. In 1939, the <br>
		National Museum Division was renamed the Natural History Museum Division of the <br>
		Bureau of Science under the office of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce.</p>

	<h3> 1945 </h3>
		<p>During the Battle of Manila in February 1945, virtually the entire national collections <br>
 		were destroyed when the Legislative Building, where most items were placed for<br> 
		safekeeping, as well as the Bureau of Science building, were reduced to ruins. After <br>
		the war, the Natural History Museum Division in 1945 was reunited with the National <br>
		Library’s Fine Arts Division to become the National Museum – its final change of name<br> 
		– under the Office of the Executive Secretary.</p>
	<h3> 1951-1975 </h3>
		<p> In 1951, the National Museum was placed under the Department of Education. <br> 
		Regulatory functions were added to the National Museum, starting in 1966 <br> 
		with the passage of Republic Act No. 4846, which provided for the protection and<br> 
		preservation of Philippine cultural properties, and continuing through the 1970s,<br> 
 		including management of important cultural sites around the country. In addition, the <br> 
		National Planetarium in Rizal Park was established under the National Museum in <br> 
		1975. During this time, the National Museum was housed in one floor of the Legislative<br> 
 		Building, as well as in a government building in Ermita, Manila. The establishment of<br> 
		the National Historical Institute in 1972 led to the transfer of diverse historical<br> 
		collections from the National Museum.</p>
	<h3> 1996 </h3>
		<p> In 1996, President Fidel V. Ramos established a presidential committee to oversee the<br> 
 		creation of a National Museum complex. Earlier in 1994, he had instructed the<br> 
 		Secretaries of Finance and Tourism to prepare for the eventual transfer of their neo-<br> 
		classical buildings in Rizal Park to the National Museum, and in 1995, the Finance<br> 
 		Building was turned over. The Department of Tourism was scheduled to transfer<br> 
 		custody of the Tourism building by the end of 1997, but this initiative was delayed. In a<br> 
		historic move, the Senate of the Philippines also vacated its chambers in the<br> 
 		Executive House to allow for the landmark building to be incorporated into the<br> 
 		National Museum precinct.</p>
	<h3> 1998 </h3>
		<p> On February 12, 1998, Republic Act No. 8492, The National Museum Act of 1998, was<br>
 		approved as the new charter of the National Museum that reestablished the<br>
 		institution as an autonomous government trust instrumentality under a Board of<br>
 		Trustees, and which designated the President of the Philippines as the Honorary<br>
 		Chairman and Patron of the National Museum. Later that year, the first stage of the<br>
 		National Museum complex was realized with the formal inauguration of the Museum<br>
 		of the Filipino People in the converted Old Finance Building, a key part of official <br>
		commemoration of the centennial of Philippine independence that culminated on<br>
 		June 12, 1998.<br>
		<br>
		Under the administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III, the vision for the National<br>
 		Museum complex in Manila as formulated in the 1990s was revived, with the turnover <br>
		of the Tourism Building that will allow for the establishment of the permanent home of <br>
		the national natural history collections, in line with the housing of the national <br>
		anthropological and archaeological collections in the Old Finance Building and the <br>
		national fine arts collections in the Old Legislative Building. Together these collections <br>
		all encompass a significant and considerable part of the national patrimony that the <br>
		National Museum preserves in perpetual trust for the Filipino people. </p>
	<h3> 2018 to Present </h3>
		<p>One of the recent milestones of the National Museum of the Philippines is the long <br>
		time coming realization of its National Museum Complex, which is enacted by the law <br>
		in 1998 under the Republic Act 8492.  It was on June 28, 2016 that the National <br>
		Museum of Natural History was initially launched through a ceremonial turnover of <br>
		the Tree of Life with its unveiling by then President Benigno Aquino III with his cabinet <br>
		secretaries as representatives.  Finally, on May 18, 2018, highlighting the International <br>
		Museum Day celebration, is the public opening of the National Museum of Natural <br>
		History.<br>
		<br>
		With the growth and expansion of the National Museum’s scope and functions, on <br>
		April 26, 2019, the Republic Act 11333, also known as the National Museum of the <br>
		Philippines Act, was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte.  The law was enacted to <br>
		strengthen the mandate of the institution in the management and development of <br>
		museums and collections of national importance in field of arts, cultural heritage, and <br>
		natural history making the museum more responsive to the 21st century and needs <br>
		and demands of its stakeholders.</p>
