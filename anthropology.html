<img src="An2.jpg" alt="Legislative Building" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>In last days of the Second World War’s Battle of Manila, the Department of <br>
Finance Building along with the Legislative Building served as part of the <br>
Japanese defensive installations. For seven days (from February 25 until March 3) <br>
the American forces bombarded the building with heavy artillery fire. The stability <br>
of reinforced concrete buildings to withstood impact force of artillery fire and <br>
bombardment were tested such that the building’s northeast walls and roofs <br>
disintegrated, settled and bent.  The building was heavily devastated.<br>
<br>
The building was rebuilt in 1949, maintaining its original building footprint and five <br>
story height.  The five-story building has an odd trapezium plan with a chamfer at <br>
its northeast obtuse vertex and a concave side on its southeast fronting the rotonda. <br>
A ground level approach on a driveway protected by a three-arched porte cochere serves as the <br>
entrance at the chamfered northeast corner of the building. Halls and rooms are <br>
orthogonally arranged around the central courtyard of the same trapezium shape.</p>
<hr>
<img src="An3.jpg" alt="Legislative Building" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>The façades are articulated with giant Corinthian columns and pilasters rising <br>
from the second floor level to the height of the three stories of the building, with <br>
the first story resembling the one-story high plinth where these columns and <br>
pilasters rest.<br>
<br>
Decorative entablatures lie above the columns and pilasters surrounding the <br>
entire wall.  The exterior walls have incised masonry joint pattern that provide a <br>
sense of scale and texture. Rhythmic fenestrations reverberate with arched and <br>
rectangular openings.  Arched windows are on the second story, and rectangular <br>
windows on the rest, are all decorated with ornate grillework. Pairs of giant <br>
Corinthian columns framing a two-story high arched window reinforce the corners of the <br>
building. A modest pediment accentuates the chamfered corner entrance.</p>

<img src="An4.jpg" alt="Museum of Anthropology" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>As the present National Museum of Anthropology, the new additions on the <br>
east and west of the original building footprint serve as additional spaces for <br>
the museum building’s utilities.  A grand stairway as broad as the concave <br>
southeast façade serves as the main access rising up to the columned portico <br>
on the second floor level. The columned portico features six fluted columns <br>
with Corinthian capitals. Four arched openings are distributed alternately with <br>
rectangular windows in the seven bays of the southeast entrance wall. From <br>
the columned porticoes, a splendid view of Luneta can be enjoyed apart from <br>
the sights, silhouettes and remnants of Beaux Arts architecture of the other <br>
monumental building.<br>
<br>
Classic symmetry is best exemplified in the architecture of the two identical buildings designed by Antonio Mañalac Toledo. The Old <br>
Department of Finance Building and the Old Department of Agriculture and Commerce Building are laid out with the line of symmetry <br>
along the east-west axis of the Agrifina Rotunda (or Agrifina Circle) in Luneta. The two buildings face each other in mirror image, an <br>
ensemble of neoclassic-inspired buildings.  Envisioned then to be the National Museum Complex, by virtue of Republic Act 8492 in <br>
1998, the first stage of the National Museum complex was realized with the formal inauguration of the Museum of the Filipino People <br>
in the converted Old Finance Building, a key part of official commemoration of the centennial of Philippine independence that <br>
culminated on June 12, 1998. <br>
<br>
Today, the building is staging the Philippine ethnographic and terrestrial and underwater archaeological collections narrating the <br>
story of the Philippines from the past, as presented through artifacts as evidences of its pre-history and is now called the National <br>
Museum of Anthropology.</p>
