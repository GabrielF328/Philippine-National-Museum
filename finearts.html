<p>Along Padre Burgos Street heading southwest, the monumental Old Legislative <br>
Building is presently the National Museum of Fine Arts.  The building designed <br>
by Ralph Harrington Doane, Antonio Mañalac Toledo and Juan M. Arellano was <br>
built between 1918-1926.  Doane with the assistance of Toledo, designed the <br>
building originally as the National Library. The building began its construction in <br>
1918, was delayed for lack of funds, and was decided to become the Legislative <br>
Building. Arellano revised the plan by adding the fourth floor and the chambers for <br>
legislators, changing the central façade and incorporating the ornamentation and <br>
sculptural work.</p>
<hr>

<p>In February 1945 the Japanese forces used the building and its premises as <br>
their stronghold and modified it with their defensive installations. Obstacles, <br>
roadblocks, trenches, pillboxes and barbed wires surrounded the building. Guns <br>
and other heavy machine guns were strategically installed on the building <br>
floors. For several days until February 27 the American forces bombarded the <br>
building with artillery fire. The building’s north and south wings were heavily <br>
damaged.</p>
<hr>
<img src="FA4.jpg" alt="Fine Arts Museum"width="300px"height="200px">
<p>The columned portico at the second floor signals the west entrance accessed <br>
through the flights of stairs and the carriageway ramp coming from the ground <br>
level along Padre Burgos Street. The west portico has four Corinthian columns <br>
rising the full height of the building.<br>
<br>
The façades are articulated with giant Corinthian columns and pilasters rising <br>
from the second floor level to the height of the two stories of the building, with <br>
the first story resembling the one-story high plinth where these columns and <br>
pilasters rest.<br>
<br>
Decorative entablatures lie above the columns and pilasters surrounding the entire wall.  The projecting central bay features a group <br>
of four columns, with corbeled balconies on the third level. The corner bays feature another group of four columns with similar <br>
Corinthian capitals. Fenestrations feature rectangular windows decorated with grillework. Both east and west façades are identical <br>
except for the west central bay with the columned portico. Surmounting the central part of the building are identical east and west <br>
pediments with relief sculptures. The temple pediment with relief sculptures depicting “Inang Bayan” surrounded by Greek deities on <br>
its tympanum emphasizes grandeur and nationalism, and ennobles the edifice. A splendid view of Intramuros and Luneta can be <br>
enjoyed from the west and south of the building respectively.<br>
<br>
The building’s east façade is identical with the west façade except for the central bay. An arched porte-cochere protects the east <br>
entrance at the ground level approached by way of the east driveway from the present east open space (formerly a southward radial <br>
road with Agrifina Circle as its terminus).<br>
<br><br>
On September 30, 2010, by virtue of Republic Act 10096 vesting the power to declare historical landmarks to the National Historical <br>
Commission of the Philippines (NHCP), the building was declared as a National Historical Landmark under Resolution No. 8 dated <br>
September 30, 2010.  The declaration is an act of honoring the significance of the building as witness to various political historical <br>
milestones of the country such as the Constitutional Convention in 1934, inauguration of Presidents namely Manuel L. Quezon of the <br>
Commonwealth government in 1935, Jose P. Laurel during the Japanese-sponsored government in 1943, and Manuel Roxas of the <br>
Commonwealth government in 1946.  During the Martial Law in 1972, it was used as an Executive House of the Prime Minister and <br>
eventually became offices of various government branches.   A marker commemorating the declaration was unveiled on October 29, <br>
2010.</p>

<p>Highlighting the celebration of the National Museum of the<br>
Philippines’ 111th anniversary on October 29, 2012, then President <br>
Benigno S. Aquino III graced the event for his inauguration of the <br>
restored old Senate Session Hall.  The two-year restoration project <br>
aimed to bring back its pre-war architectural glory that is intended to <br>
be part of the learning tours of museum visitors. <br>
<br>
Pursuant to Republic Act 8491 of 1998 known as the Flag and <br>
Heraldic Code of the Philippines, on July 16, 2019, the NHCP <br>
unveiled the Philippine Flag Hoisting marker at the National Museum <br>
of Fine Arts to honor the site’s historic value. In view of this, the <br>
Philippine Flag is to be permanently hoisted and lighted at night at <br>
the National Museum of Fine Arts.<br>

<p>As the present National Museum of Fine Arts, new additions north and <br>
south of the building footprint serve as the museum building’s <br>
administrative offices, and public spaces. Sculptures accentuates the <br>
building’s grounds and open spaces.  The open spaces east of the <br>
building serve as a visual corridor where one can enjoy the perspectives of the <br>
surrounding urban spaces and the other neo-classical building across the <br>
road, the present National Museum of Anthropology (former Department of <br>
Finance Building).<br>
<br>
Today, the building as the National Museum of Fine Arts, is a home to 29 <br>
galleries and hallway exhibitions comprising of 19th century Filipino <br>
masters, National Artists, leading modern painters, sculptors, and printmakers. <br>
Also on view are art loans from other government institutions, organizations, and individuals.</p>
