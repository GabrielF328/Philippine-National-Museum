<img src="NH1.jpg" alt="Agriculture and Commerce Building" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>The building was constructed as the Agriculture and <br>
Commerce Building in 1940 and designed in neoclassical style <br>
by Filipino Architect Antonio Toledo in the late 1930s, having <br>
the same dimension and floor plan as its twin building located <br>
at the northern side of the circle, the Finance Building.<br>
<br>
Similar with the Department of Finance Building, a grand <br>
stairway as broad as the concave northwest façade of the <br>
Department of Agriculture Building serves as the main access <br>
rising up to the columned portico on the second floor level. <br>
The portico features six fluted columns with Corinthian <br>
capitals. Four arched openings are distributed alternately <br>
with rectangular windows in the seven bays of the northeast <br>
entrance wall.<br>
<br>
The façades are articulated with giant Corinthian columns and pilasters rising from the second floor level to the height of the three <br>
stories of the building, with the first story resembling the one-story high plinth where these columns and pilasters rest. Decorative <br>
entablatures are supported by the columns and pilasters surrounding the entire wall. Incised masonry joint pattern articulates the <br>
exterior walls to provide a sense of scale. Rhythmic fenestrations such as arched windows on the second story, and rectangular <br>
windows on the rest, are all decorated with ornate grillework. Pairs of giant Corinthian columns framing a two-story high arched <br>
window reinforce the corners of the building.</p>
<hr>
<img src="NH2.jpg" alt="Agriculture and Commerce Building" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>The Department of Agriculture and Commerce building was among the<br>
government buildings reconstructed in 1949, under the government’s <br>
post-war rehabilitation work program. In February 1945 the American <br>
forces bombarded the building with heavy artillery fire (from February 25 <br>
until February 28), concentrated on the ground floor until the lower <br>
sections have been pulverized and the upper sections settled on the <br>
ground.<br>
<br>
Symmetrical with the Department of Finance Building, the five-story <br>
Department of Agriculture and Commerce Building has an odd <br>
trapezium plan with a chamfer at its southeast obtuse vertex and <br>
a concave side on its northwest fronting the rotonda. A ground level <br>
approach on a driveway protected by a three-arched porte cochere <br>
serves as the entrance at the chamfered southeast corner of the building. 
Halls and rooms are orthogonally arranged around the central courtyard of the <br>
same trapezium shape. A modest pediment accentuates the chamfered <br>
corner entrance.</p>

<img src="NH3.jpg" alt="Agriculture and Commerce Building" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>Keeping its historical value, the building reconstruction using the <br>
adaptive reuse architecture or the restoration of an old building to <br>
convert it into a space for something other than its original purpose <br>
commenced in 2013.  What used to be a building occupied by the <br>
Department of Tourism is now home to displays of diverse botanical, <br>
zoological, and geological collections of the country.<br>
<br>
As the present National Museum of Natural History, the recent new <br>
additions on the east and west of the original building footprint, and <br>
on top of the original building height, serve as the museum building’s <br>
facilities, offices and public spaces. The metal-framed glass dome <br>
known as the “Tree of Life” now covers the central courtyard. The <br>
open spaces southeast of the building serve as a visual corridor where <br>
one can enjoy the perspectives of the surrounding urban spaces and <br>
the other neo-classical buildings.</p>

<p>Prior to its public opening, on June 28, 2016, the National Museum of <br>
Natural History was initially launched through the ceremonial turnover of <br>
the Tree of Life, which was unveiled by President Benigno Aquino III <br>
through his cabinet secretaries as representatives.  On May 18, 2018, <br>
highlighting the International Museum Day celebration, the long time <br>
coming National Museum Complex was finally realized through the <br>
public opening of the National Museum of Natural History. It has the <br>
concept of presenting its collections from the mountain to the sea, <br>
which are exhibited through interactive displays, video guides, diagrams, <br>
and illustrations integrated to zoological, botanical, and geological specimens <br>
on display at the 12 galleries and its halls.  Today, it has been one of the <br>
most visited educational tourist destinations in Metro Manila.</p>
