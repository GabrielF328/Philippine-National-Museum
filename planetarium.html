<p>The National Planetarium was established on September 30, 1975 under <br>
the management of the National Museum of the Philippines through <br>
Presidential Decree No. 804-A, signed by President Ferdinand E. Marcos.<br> 
It was formally inaugurated by then First Lady Imelda Marcos and <br>
opened to the public on October 8, 1975. At that time, it was the biggest <br>
planetarium in the Southeast Asian region.</p>
<hr>
<img src="Pla2.jpg" alt="Planetarium" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>The big domed-structure, with its 310-seating capacity, was designed by <br>
Filipino architect Federico S. Ilustre. Its construction began in 1974 under <br>
the Bureau of Public Works (now Department of Public Works and <br>
Highways [DPWH]), along Padre Burgos Avenue in Rizal Park, and was <br>
one of the priority projects of Mrs. Marcos, then National Parks <br>
Development Committee Chairperson. The Japanese Reparation <br>
Program to the Philippines funded the construction that took nine <br>
months to complete. The exhibition’s development was led by then <br>
National Museum Director Godofredo Alcasid, Sr., with the help of the <br>
first curator of the planetarium, Mr. Maximo Sacro Jr.  The acquisition of <br>
the GM-15 star projector and auxiliary projectors from Japan’s GOTO Inc., <br>
a newly innovated planetarium projector at that time, was also funded by <br>
the Japan Reparation Program. </p>
<hr>
<img src="Pla3.jpg" alt="Planetarium" width="300px" height="200px">
<p>The National Planetarium has since undergone necessary renovations a few <br>
times through its 43 years. The first major work was undertaken from 1992 to <br>
1995 after the dome collapsed due to the tremors of the 1990 earthquake and <br>
from the construction of the Rizal Park Open-Air Auditorium.  In 2009, the sky <br>
shows were reprogrammed, and a new exhibition on Philippine indigenous <br>
myths and beliefs relevant to astronomy, asteroids, and comets were installed.<br>
<br>
The most recent renovations began in 2016, which involved a series of <br>
structural, technical, and program upgrades of the National Planetarium <br>
facility. The dome structure and viewing room was repaired and refurbished in <br>
2016. The original 310-seating capacity auditorium now houses 224 modern cinema <br>
chairs which now face a unidirectional orientation. This was followed by the <br>
integration of the full-dome digital planetarium system GOTO Virtuarium X to the <br>
GM-15 Star Projector of more than 40 years before. The once center focused <br>
planetarium show can now be viewed in full-dome. New lineup of shows are: <br>
‘A Planet for Goldilocks’, which is about an exploration of planets beyond our <br>
solar system; ‘Hayabusa: Back to the Earth’, which is about a Japanese satellite <br>
whose mission is to gather rock samples from a near earth asteroid called “Itokawa”; <br>
and ‘Journey to a Billion Suns’, which is about the origins of the billions of stars <br>
located in our milky way galaxy.</p>

<p>Work towards shifting the exhibitions to focus on the astronomical <br>
knowledge of different Philippine ethnolinguistic groups and highlight <br>
the contributions of Filipino scientists to modern astronomy began soon <br>
after. The newly renovated ethnoastronomy exhibition was launched to <br>
the public in January 2019.</p>
